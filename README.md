# Hand-Gesture-Recognition

An exploratory machine learning project with the aim to classify hand gestures from a live camera feed as letters and symbols from the American Sign Language (ASL). The model was trained on Google Colab.
Submitted as the final Computer Science project in Grade XII in 2022.
For a detailed overview, working, and methodology refer to [the project file](<Hand Gesture Recognition.pdf>)

A demonstration of the project operating on a live camera feed is available [as a video](Demonstration.mp4).

Following are some classifications carried out by the model (also available in [the project file](<Hand Gesture Recognition.pdf>)):

![L classified as L](images/L%20as%20L.png)
